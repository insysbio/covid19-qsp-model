(1) SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics model was constracted and initially calibrated
(2) The model allows to reproduce multiple steady state behavior, i.e., depending on initial viral concentration administered, VP attends either healthy (virus = 0) or disease steady state  
(3) Initial efforts were done to demonstrate effect of Immune Response (IR) on system response expressed in terms of viral load.
